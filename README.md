## üìå Overview  

This project investigates how various movie attributes contribute to IMDb scores using multiple regression modeling techniques. The analysis includes rigorous **exploratory data analysis**, **variable transformation**, **multicollinearity checks**, and **model diagnostics** to ensure accurate and interpretable predictions.  

**Key contributions include:**  
- EDA on budget, duration, media coverage, and genre factors.  
- Stepwise model selection using BIC.  
- Addressing multicollinearity with VIF and eigenvalue decomposition.  
- Implementing nonlinear modeling via Box-Cox transformation, splines, and polynomial terms.  
- Forecasting IMDb scores for 12 unreleased movies in 2025.

## üé¨ Dataset Description  

A cleaned version of the **IMDb Winter 2025 Dataset**, consisting of:
- ~2,000 historical movies
- Detailed features: budget, duration, language, maturity rating, number of articles, IMDbPro rank, genre, etc.

## üîç Modeling Pipeline  

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Removal of high-cardinality categorical variables (e.g., Director).
   - Category merging (e.g., Language ‚Üí English vs Other).
2. **Initial Model**
   - Baseline regression model: R¬≤ = 35.18%
3. **Model Selection**
   - Stepwise regression with BIC for parsimony.
4. **Multicollinearity Analysis**
   - VIF diagnostics and eigenvalue decomposition.
5. **Nonlinear Transformations**
   - Target variable: Box-Cox power transform.
   - Predictors: log transform, polynomial (up to degree 3), quadratic duration, splines on Release Year.
6. **Influence Diagnostics**
   - Leverage, Cook‚Äôs distance, DFFITS ‚Üí 70 outliers removed.
7. **Interaction Effects**
   - Notably: Movie Budget √ó Action Genre, Movie Budget √ó Release Year (after mean).

| MAPE (Test Set)            | 12.07%    |

### Cross-Validation Results:
| Method   | RMSE   | MAPE    |
|---------|--------|---------|
| 5-Fold  | 0.76   | 9.96%   |
| 10-Fold | 0.75   | 9.94%   |
| LOOCV   | 0.74   | 9.94%   |

## üéØ Insights and Managerial Implications  

- **Budget ‚â† Better Ratings**: Higher production budgets do not guarantee higher IMDb scores.  
- **Genre Influence**: Drama and animation genres score better, action and horror underperform.  
- **Publicity Paradox**: More media coverage boosts ratings up to a point ‚Äî excessive exposure may backfire.  
- **Runtime Sweet Spot**: Audiences favor movies with balanced durations (90‚Äì120 minutes).  
- **Structural Shifts**: Post-2001 films exhibit different patterns ‚Äî modeled via piecewise splines.
